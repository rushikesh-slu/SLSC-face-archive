**User FAQ: YES SLSC Face Tagging Project**

**Q1: What is the YES SLSC Face Tagging Project?**
A1: The YES SLSC Face Tagging Project is an innovative initiative that utilizes computer vision (CV) technology to extract and cluster faces from a collection of over 250 images. The project automatically groups similar faces and assigns unique IDs to each cluster, streamlining the process of organizing and categorizing faces.

**Q2: How does the face clustering work?**
A2: The project employs advanced computer vision algorithms to analyze facial features in the images. It identifies similarities between faces and groups them together in clusters. Each cluster is assigned a specific ID, allowing you to easily identify and manage different individuals.

**Q3: How can I get started with the project?**
A3: To begin using the YES SLSC Face Tagging Project, you'll need access to the provided image dataset. You can explore the clusters of faces and their corresponding unique IDs to see how the images have been organized.

**Q4: Can I use this project for my own images?**
A4: While the current implementation is tailored to the provided image dataset, the underlying face clustering techniques can be adapted for other image collections. However, further customization and integration may be required based on your specific requirements.

**Q5: How accurate is the face clustering process?**
A5: The accuracy of the face clustering depends on the quality of the images and the complexity of the dataset. While the project strives for accuracy, it's recommended to review and potentially refine the clusters as needed. currently we are on 80% accuracy

**Q6: What if I encounter issues with the project?**
A6: If you encounter any issues while using the YES SLSC Face Tagging Project, feel free to reach out to our support team via [contact email or forum link]. We're here to assist you with troubleshooting and resolving any challenges you may face.

**Q7: Can I contribute to the project's development?**
A7: Absolutely! We welcome contributions from individuals interested in improving and expanding the project. You can find information on how to contribute in the [contribution guidelines or link to the repository].

**Q8: Is there a user guide or tutorial available?**
A8: Yes, we provide a comprehensive user guide and tutorial in the readme file. This guide will walk you through the steps of using the project, understanding the clusters, and making the most of the features.
